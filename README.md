## Task
The Goal of this homework was to write important functions and algorithm from scratch.
the Task was divided into 3 main chunks:
1) __HASHING__: in this first task we had to implement our hash function and use it to create an HyperLogLog structure. The final goal was to estimate the _cardinality_ of the                     dataset and the _error_ of our filter
2) __CLUSTERING__:in the second task we had to implement our K-Means algorithm for clustering(Lloyd's algorithm) and compare it with the inbuilt K-Means ++ algorithm for sklearn
                  we had also to answer to some _analysis of the obtained clusters_ questions. 
3) __ALGORITHMIC QUESTION__:The last task was to prove that we can sort an array A with n integer numbers in time O(n + r)

## Repo structure
` Homework4.ipynb: `
> Jupyter Notebook that contain the main code and the results of our implementations

` functions.py: `
> python files with our functions we call in the main Jupyter Notebook file

### N.B:
> in the main file, starting from the __KMeans ++ Method :__ the results you can see are related to a smaller dataset(just 20000k rows). Since we didn't have enought time we couldn't run the whole dataset but the results for the slice of data are available as an evidence that this functions works properly and _merry christmas :)_
